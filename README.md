**Overview:**
We extract data from the website https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/List_of_United_States_cities_by_population about population in cities in the US, clean the data and store it in a dataframe. Further, we parse through links to each city from the table to get a snippet of information about the city, we are going to use as the summary. The collected data cacn then be exported to a BigQuery importable csv file.

**Files:**
We have the main.ipynb which is our main code used to extract and clean data. The second file is the output of the code as a .csv file
